# Catnork-Technologies-Ltd
I designed a secure internal network for improved operational efficiency for catnork technologies ltd

# Project Overview
This project showcases a detailed functional internal network simulated for catnork technologies using cisco packect tracer featuring a routing protocol, switches, desktop PCs, a laptop used by an engineer, DHCP and DNS server and a web server hosting the internal company site. devices are grouped across departments and connected through different switches, with all traffic routed through a central router.After building the network with all necessary devices and services, Access Control List (ACL) was configured on the router to ensure that only the engineering laptop can access the webserver via HTTP. All other devices were restricted from HTTP access to the webserver but maintained access to other network services.

# Key features
# 1. Router: 
connects different networks such as LAN to the internet or to other LANs

# 2. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): 
authomatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a network

# 3. Domain Name System (DNS): 
this resolves domain name into IP addresses so that devices can locate and communicate with websites and services on the internet or internal networks.

# 3. Access Control List (ACLs):
this controls what traffic is allowed or denied on a network by matching specific conditions, helping to enforce security and traffic control.
